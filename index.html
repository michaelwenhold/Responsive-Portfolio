      <img src="assets/images/michael.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Michael">

      <p>I was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Yup, my family came over on the Mayflower and landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620.
        Who knows, that last part could be true. My parents moved to South Texas when I was about five so I guess that
        really makes me a Texan. Growing up in Corpus Christi wasn't all that exciting. The city is best known for the
        beaches and Selena (google her).</p>

      <p>I have my Bachelor's degree in Business and my Master's degree in Human Resource Management. For the past six years,
        I have worked for an international adoption agency. We currently faciliate adoptions from Bulgaria, Burundi,
        China, Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Latvia. We also have orphan hosting and student exchange programs. The
        work is very rewarding but definitely takes it's toll on a person after a while.</p>
